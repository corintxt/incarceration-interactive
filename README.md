## Data notes / to-do

* Rewrite intro text on select page

* Input type `submit` displays as submit query on Firefox. (possibly this is fine)

* Fix `width: 100` problem in Chrome on Windows

* Barber County, Kansas - jail population less than pre-trial jail pop.

* Connecticut/Windham County - 'reduction operation 'argmax' not allowed for this dtype' => no jail pop.

* Bristol bay borough, AK - ?
* Kusilvak census area, AK - NoneType

Finally: 
* Test with as many counties as possible
* Create prod branch / switch off debug mode in prod app
* Add a google tracker for stats (?)
