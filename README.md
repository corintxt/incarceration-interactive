## Data notes / to-do

* Input type `submit` displays as submit query on Firefox. (possibly this is fine)

* Fix `width: 100` problem in Chrome on Windows

* Make session key generate each time 

* Barber County, Kansas - jail population less than pre-trial jail pop.

* Connecticut/Windham County - 'reduction operation 'argmax' not allowed for this dtype' => no jail pop.

Finally: 
* Test with as many counties as possible
* Add personal links in About / header.
* Register a domain
* Switch off debug mode in production app.
* Add a google tracker for stats (?)
