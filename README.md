## Vega notes
* The most up-to-date examples of Vega usage are in the [Vega-Embed repo](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed)


## Data notes / to-do
* When the value of prison data is `null` for a given county we should not show a chart. (Example: Benton County)

* Make some 'quick win' charts with data that already exists as csv columns

* Fill in missing body text, tweak design

* Test with as many counties as possible

Error:
Connecticut/Windham County - 'reduction operation 'argmax' not allowed for this dtype'
